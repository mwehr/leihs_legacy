Feature: Picking list

  Um die Gegenstände in den Gestellen möglichst schnell zu finden
  möchte ich als Verleiher
  dass mir das System eine Rüstliste mit Auflistung der jeweiligen Gestellen gibt

  Background:
    Given I am Pius

  Scenario: What I want to see on the picking list
    When I open a picking list
    Then I want to see the following sections in the picking list:
    | Section  |
    | Date     |
    | Title    |
    | Borrower |
    | Lender   |
    | List     |

  Scenario: Content of a picking list before hand over -- unassigned inventory codes
    Given there is a hand over with at least one unproblematic model and an option
    And I open the hand over
    And I assign an inventory code to the unproblematic model
    And the item is assigned to the line
    And a line has no item assigned yet and this line is marked
    And an option line is marked
    When I open the picking list
    Then the lists are sorted by hand over date
    And each list contains the following columns
      | Column                            |
      | Quantity                          |
      | Inventory code                    |
      | Model name                        |
      | available quantity x Room / Shelf |
    And each list will sorted after models, then sorted after room and shelf of the most available locations
    And in the list, the assigned items will displayed with inventory code, room and shelf
    And in the list, the not assigned items will displayed without inventory code
    And the missing location information for options, are displayed with "Location not defined"
